# CONCATENATION
"""
Concatenation takes you to another level of coding, with this you can join
two or strings together, in cases where your variable values can change anytime concatenation
makes it easier, shorter and better. There are different ways of concatenations but i would show you
the basic one which is the + character, and later on a more advance one which is the f-string(string manipulation)
"""
first_name = "Solomon"
last_name = "Bestz"
"""
We would add an empty string with space in between our first_name and last_name,
so the output would look more nicer
"""
# print(first_name+last_name) 


# PROGRAM TO SUM TWO NUMBERS
"""
We would be summing two numbers with this program
"""

first_num = int(input("Enter First Number: "))
second_num = int(input("Enter Second Number: "))


sum_num = first_num + second_num

print(f"The answer is: {sum_num}")
