"""
In our street variable we have three houses, 
say I boarded a bike going to house3 i wont be 
able to get to house3 if i don't know the address and in our case our
house numbering starts from index 0
"""
"""
Getting the house isn't difficult, we just need to 
call the variable and place in the number in a square bracket 
and we can access the house that way..

# street = ['house1', 'house2', 'house3']

#     print(house)

The above loop we have written would print out all the houses in our
street list
